    * steps to install and run your app
	Download the Github repository, and run the application in Visual Studio (Windows)

    * did you complete the project? comment as needed.
	The parcel data API doesn't exist under the URL provided in the instructions, and I couldn't find any other API.
	Also, the weather APIs usually don't have the historical data for free. The Web API I used only provides histrical data
	for recent dates (around a month). I had to manually change the dates in one of the json files so I can test it.

    * how much time did you spend on the project?
	I spent around 6 hours throughout the day, but out of that, I spent around 2-3 hours looking for APIs.

    * Add a couple of screen shots to the repo that show the working version as running on your machine. 
	They are in the repo.
